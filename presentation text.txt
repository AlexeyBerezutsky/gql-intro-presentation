Typical REST API. Server have no idea about how data will be used (it’s ok) and sends whatever it knows about some entity. All entities are atomic.

http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/2
Common issues
Over-fetching – it’s case when client receive too much. What can happen: 
-	system of entities is not perfect
-	 obsolete API
-	System was designed to work with other service, but we must use it’s api for UI
-	 system designed to work with Desktop application, but company stared to develop mobile version of application and it has to use Desktop api   
UI has issue: to much data and not really clear what it is and how to use it. 
Typical solution is tu introduce tons of filters and parameters to query. And they become complex.
And developers has to create they own language of queries. => nobody except them will understand this language. 
Under-fetching - it’s situation when you have to create another fetches after initial fetch to get whole information for your work. 
One request has part of information => you have to investigate it => create another request for another byte of it. 
Additional roud-trip to server => additional networking => additional resources and issues with performance.
Solution => expands. But this solution is completely custom. There is no any standard on how it should be used across different projects.
API changes and evaluation:
How to maintain changes: 
-	Versioning. When api has some version and you have to maintain old versions because some of you clients are using it
-	Deprecation – when at some point we would say to client: in one month we will remove this field.  And we have to manage it => additional costs
-	Maintenance -> additional costs

API Gateway
People were trying to fix those issues with different patterns like “API Gateway” .
All internal apis are covered with big api which keeps clear on what we expose and what we not expose. 
But this kind of api have to work with different kind of clients who has different requirements. For instance mobile applications, 
browsers and external service (browsers could create tons of requests per session, mobile could create one request per half an hour if it’s in background mode, 
external server has completely different data requirements).
And peoples have to create different endpoints for different clients. => all endpoints are custom and we have to maintain all of them.

QGL approach 
BE not a set of endpoint => only on eendpoint
BE provide whole data as graph. => no need to save business logic into FE
BE provides Documentation
BE provides type system
FE ask ony what iat actually need




http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/11
Type system

Big advantage of GQL responses that they are type save. 
It very familiar to typescript and it’s easy to integrate to TS.
Great feature that type system is exposed to outside from API and all your clients will be typed. 
On BE you have to explain GQL what type is it. All future examples will be for JS.
GQL has interfaces, unions, enums.

Graphql trying to represent your system like a graph. Graph has no start and end. It has nodes that are connected somehow. And you have to traverse your graph from some point. 
And graphQL has suggested start points: QUERY MUTATION SUBSCRIPTIONS.  May be in some situation you could think about them like about root types.


http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/13
Graphiql  - small application build on top of graphql. 
It’a absolutely generic and has no idea about api. It only knows one endpoint and it knows how to load types.

Example of fragments 
==============================
query {
  allUsers{
   ...Foo
    comments{
     ...Foo
    }
  }
}
fragment Foo on Node {
  id
}
===================================


If you have tons of components each component will be exposed like …Fragment1 …fragment2 etc
=====================================
query {
  allUsers{
    
   ...UserFragment
    
    comments{
      
     ...CommentFragment
      
    }
  }
}

fragment UserFragment on User {
  id
  name
}

fragment CommentFragment on Comment {
  id
  text
}

=========
Directives

query Users($addComments: Boolean!){
  allUsers {
    id
    comments @include(if: $addComments){
      text
    }
  }
}

{
    "addComments": true
}
=========



Introspection
You could go really deep in types 
=======================================
query {
__schema{
  queryType{
    name
  }
}
__type(name: "User"){
  fields{
    name   
  }
}
}
===========================================
MUTATION

==========================================
mutation UpdateUserComment($id: ID!, $comment: String!) {
  updateUser(id: $id, comments: [{text:$comment}]) {
    id
    comments{
      text
    }
  }
}

{
  "id":  "cju6uoeoy05q701705863fk00",
  "comment": "bla-bbla"
}

So. On FE you have all types, all handlers to change data, schemas, documentation. With the help of introspection you could grab all data about types 
=> GraphQl applications are completely BE Agnostic
GQL do not care about all your technologies on BE and simply resolves what FE is needed
Transport: client defines transport. For instance client could set WS or set TCP connection and send binaries.  And you steel use graphql.



http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/15
More features
Deferred values. N+1Problem. Entity1 connected to Entity2. an d you have to create two  quaries. Instead of that you could wait untill GQL 
quary on BE for all inforamtion and will return you whole information that you need 

Query resucers. Endpoint allows to abuse properties of query and use it in non correct way. 
!!!!Reducers on BE allows to analyse query before it actually run 
and  decrease complexity of it to single value (for instance)
You could set a treshold on complexity of a quary. For instance depth.

Why you should use graphQL
Better developer experience - you have schemas, strong typing, code completeon, documentation. and all this provided by endpoint.
Complex schemas - GraphQL has ability to server really complex schemas (Facebook, github)
Different kind of clients - mobile, services, desktops
Hide complexity from clients (microservices) - you could have extremely complex BE but client will never know about it. 
Slow network with big lattency and interruptions - GraphQl shrinks data in responses, libraries support different transport and caches => all this could work in case of bad network

http://localhost:8080/#/18
Why you do NOT use GraphQL
REST already can do the same - if you want to have filtered set of properties use fields. Yes it's a custom solution, but solution. In many cases it's enought.
If you need static typization => use JSON schemas
Complexity could grow in uncontrollable way. 
1) You have graph and somebody should serve it. Otherwise it will grow like mad.
2) If you have small application all those mutations, subscriptions, etc are adding extracomplexity and maintain costs
3) Errors and Binary files are not really trivial in GQL.   
Learning curve - you have to change your mind. Instead of atomic REST endpoints you have to have sunbaked graph of entities    
Web cache with REST - Web cache on Transport level could solve tons of problems. But not incase of one endoint because all calls are going to it 
Schemas are static - You can not change schema dynamically. You do not have dynamic types. All flexibility of GQL is bounded by schema.
